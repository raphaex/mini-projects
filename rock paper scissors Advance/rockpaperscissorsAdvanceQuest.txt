 a project that plays games of rockpaperscissors the goal is to find the player who win more
and also find the highest win ratio 'pick' 
mini quest from desired outcome:
1. score system for who ever wins more
2. score system for individual picks

basic pointing system problems:
i could either go with a function that's gonna get called to add one point or just incerement it by 1 by using ++.
well first it serves the same function and more non complex way. but the thing that's bugging me is how the fuck could i do that function. and why cant i fuckn doit dude, wtf. am i just ultra dumb or what.

adding 1 to a number did not work
tried many ways of doing this;
ex:
var = var + 1
var++
return var + 1


pushing something into a array did not work 

journal:
it's a couple hours in and i can't seem to make this shitty basic function work.

AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF ASKING AROUND THE INTERNET
i've done it project done bois.
